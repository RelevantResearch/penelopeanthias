## Teaching

I am is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Geography at Durham University. My teaching focuses are on:

- **Critical Geographies**: Exploring the intersection of geography with political, social, and ecological issues.
- **Political Ecology**: Investigating how ecological and political processes shape and are shaped by human actions.
- **Indigenous and Resource Politics**: Examining struggles over land and resources from a decolonial perspective.

I encourage students to engage with complex theoretical frameworks and apply them to real-world issues, fostering a deep understanding of global socio-environmental dynamics.
