## Limits to Decolonization: Indigeneity, Territory and Hydrocarbon Politics in the Bolivian Chaco

![Limits to Decolonization](/images/book1.png)

This ethnographic account explores the Guaraní's two-decade struggle for land in the Bolivian Chaco. Despite efforts in indigenous territorial mapping, true autonomy and self-determination remain elusive. The book critically examines the limitations of mapping as a political tool and highlights ongoing resistance among indigenous peoples.

## Neoextractivism and Territorial Disputes in Latin America: Social-ecological Conflict and Resistance on the Front Lines

![Neoextractivism and Territorial Disputes](/images/book3.png)

This collected work, co-edited by Pabel C. López Flores and me, explores the expansion of extractive industries into new territories and the powerful resistance movements emerging in response. Each chapter dives into different contexts across the region, revealing how communities are standing up to protect their lands, reclaim their rights, and push back against ecological and social injustices. This book isn’t just about documenting struggles – it's about envisioning a different kind of future, one where sustainable alternatives and post-extractive possibilities are realized.
