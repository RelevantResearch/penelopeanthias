## Impact

My research and publications significantly contribute to debates in political ecology, postcolonial geographies, and critical agrarian studies. my work has:

- **Advanced Understanding**: Provided insights into how colonial relations and resource extraction dynamics are contested and reconfigured at the frontier of capitalism.
- **Influenced Policy and Activism**: My analysis of hydrocarbon citizenship and indigenous autonomy has impacted policy discussions and informed activism related to resource extraction and environmental justice.
- **Promoted Methodological Innovation**: Through my ethnographic research and documentary film-making, Dr. Anthias has introduced innovative approaches to capturing and representing socio-environmental conflicts.
