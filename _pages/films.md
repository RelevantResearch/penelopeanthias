As part of my project on extractive enclaves and unintended flows in Latin America, I directed and produced a 29-min open-access documentary called [*Don't Touch Tariquía*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3SbF-nGZbI), which charts the emergence and remarkable success of rural women's resistance to extraction in one area of the national park. Then, in 2023, I gained a Diploma in Creative Documentary Film-making at the Escuela Internacional de Cine y Television in Cuba, where I made a film about struggles over housing in a nearby textile village called [*La Casa Nueva*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTmq6xQzOkY).
