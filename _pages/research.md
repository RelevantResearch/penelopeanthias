My research explores struggles around indigeneity, territory, and the politics of resource extraction in Latin America, grounded in over 15 years of engaged ethnographic research in Bolivia’s Chaco region. This work combines theoretical insights from anti-colonial, Marxist, and Foucaultian traditions, providing an empirically grounded account of how colonial relations are reproduced and contested at resource frontiers and in struggles over land and property.

## Theoretical and Interdisciplinary Approach

I draw on a heterodox and interdisciplinary approach, contributing to debates in political ecology, postcolonial geographies, legal geography, anthropology of development, and critical agrarian studies. My work emphasizes centering the voices of Indigenous peoples and other racialized rural populations as both sources of empirical knowledge and producers of geographical theory.

## Methodological Innovation

My commitment to highlighting Indigenous voices has led to methodological experimentation. This includes long-term ethnography, participatory methods, counter-mapping, and, most recently, documentary filmmaking. These approaches allow me to offer nuanced perspectives on Indigenous struggles and land issues.

## Major Publications and Projects

#### [**Book: Limits to Decolonization**](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501714368/limits-to-decolonization/#bookTabs=1)

My first book, *Limits to Decolonization*, examines the dynamics and legacies of Bolivia’s Native Community Lands (TCOs) in the gas-rich Chaco region. This critical ethnography explores the possibilities and limitations of using maps and law as instruments of decolonization.

#### Untapped Reserves: Mapping extraction and resistance in Bolivia’s protected areas

In 2024, I was awarded a British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship to complete further research, a book manuscript and second documentary film on the political and territorial dynamics of gas extraction in Bolivia’s Tariquía Reserve of Flora and Fauna.

#### [**Research on Hydrocarbon Citizenship and State Formation**](https://doi.org/10.1177/0094582x16678804)

I developed the concept of "hydrocarbon citizenship" through an institutional ethnography of the new Autonomous Regional Government in Gran Chaco Province. This work explores how plurinationalism and extractivism interact in Bolivia's state-formation processes. It was part of the ERC-funded project *Rule and Rupture* (2016–2019) at the University of Copenhagen.

#### LEAKS – Extractive Enclaves and Unintended Flows

As a co-investigator on the *LEAKS* project (2019–2023), funded by the Independent Research Fund of Denmark, my research focused on conflicts over new natural gas development in the Tariquia National Reserve of Flora and Fauna. I examined how neoextractivism and conservation governance shape political spaces and subjectivities.

## Documentary Filmmaking

### [**Don't Touch Tariquia**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3SbF-nGZbI)

As part of the *LEAKS* project, I directed and produced *Don’t Touch Tariquia*, a 29-minute open-access documentary that captures rural women's resistance to extraction in one part of the national park. In 2023, I expanded my skills in documentary filmmaking by earning a Diploma in Creative Documentary Filmmaking from the Escuela Internacional de Cine y Television in Cuba, where I created a film on housing struggles in a textile village.

### Academic Background and Fellowships

Before joining Durham University in 2018, I held research fellowships at the University of Copenhagen and the University of California, Berkeley. I completed my PhD in Geography at the University of Cambridge in 2014.

### PhD Supervision

I welcome inquiries from prospective PhD students, particularly those interested in (post)colonial geographies and land/resource politics.
