My research focuses on struggles over indigeneity, territory, and resource extraction in Latin America, grounded in over 15 years of ethnographic work in Bolivia’s Chaco region. Drawing on anti-colonial intellectual traditions and ethnographic methodologies, I explore how colonial relations are reproduced and contested at resource frontiers, with particular attention to Indigenous perspectives and rural voices. My interdisciplinary approach spans political ecology, postcolonial geographies, and legal geography. My research methods include participatory research, counter-mapping, and documentary filmmaking to examine the complex dynamics of land, law, and extractivism in shaping Indigenous autonomy and citizenship.

### Current Research Project

#### Untapped Reserves: Mapping Extraction and Resistance in Bolivia’s Protected Areas

In 2024, I was honored to receive a British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship, which will support my further research, the development of a book manuscript, and the production of a second documentary film. This work will focus on the political and territorial dynamics of gas extraction in Bolivia’s Tariquía Reserve of Flora and Fauna.

### Previous Research Projects

#### LEAKS – Extractive Enclaves and Unintended Flows

As a co-investigator on the *LEAKS* project (2019–2023), funded by the Independent Research Fund of Denmark, my research focused on conflicts over new natural gas development in the Tariquia National Reserve of Flora and Fauna. I examined how neoextractivism and conservation governance shape political spaces and subjectivities. For more information about the film *Don’t Touch Tariquia*, which I directed and produced as part of the LEAKS project, [visit my films page](https://penelopeanthias.com/films/).

A select list of publications from prior research is available on [my publications page](https://penelopeanthias.com/publications/).
