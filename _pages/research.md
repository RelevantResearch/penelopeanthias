My research focuses on struggles over indigeneity, territory, and resource extraction in Latin America, grounded in over 15 years of ethnographic work in Bolivia’s Chaco region.

My work has shaped inter-disciplinary debates on extractivism, territory and decolonial politics. In particular, I have made theoretical advances to scholarly understandings of the relationship between hydrocarbons and citizenship in neoextractivist states, the limits and legacies of neoliberal multiculturalism (ethnoterritorial recognition) for Indigenous movements, and the micropolitics of race and property at (post)colonial frontiers.

Concretely, my research has involved a series of in-depth case studies that illuminate how fossil capitalism articulates with (post)colonial struggles over territory and citizenship in ways that produce new subjectivities, governable spaces, and political horizons. These have included a Guaraní territorial claim overlying Bolivia’s biggest gas field, a regional autonomy project that linked plurinationalism to gas rents, and a conflict over gas development in a protected area.

My approach is interdisciplinary and engages a range of critical literatures on law, rights, extraction, territory, indigeneity, and (de)coloniality. In addition to ethnographic methods, I have deployed counter-mapping and documentary filmmaking to examine the micropolitics of land, law, and extractivism as they shape Indigenous autonomy and citizenship.

### Current Research Project

#### Untapped Reserves: Mapping Extraction and Resistance in Bolivia’s Protected Areas

In 2024, I was honored to receive a British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship, which will support my further research, the development of a book manuscript, and the production of a second documentary film. This work will focus on the political and territorial dynamics of gas extraction in Bolivia’s Tariquía Reserve of Flora and Fauna.

### Previous Research Projects

#### LEAKS – Extractive Enclaves and Unintended Flows

As a co-investigator on the *LEAKS* project (2019–2023), funded by the Independent Research Fund of Denmark, my research focused on conflicts over new natural gas development in the Tariquia National Reserve of Flora and Fauna. I examined how neoextractivism and conservation governance shape political spaces and subjectivities. For more information about the film *Don’t Touch Tariquia*, which I directed and produced as part of the LEAKS project, [visit my films page](https://penelopeanthias.com/films/).
