My research examines the struggles surrounding indigeneity, territory, and resource extraction in Latin America, particularly based on over 15 years of ethnographic work in Bolivia’s Chaco region. I contribute to interdisciplinary discussions on extractivism, territory, and decolonial politics, focusing on the interplay between hydrocarbons and citizenship in neoextractivist states, the implications of neoliberal multiculturalism for Indigenous movements, and the micro-politics of race and property at (post)colonial frontiers. Through in-depth case studies, I explore how fossil capitalism intersects with (post)colonial struggles, shaping new subjectivities, governable spaces, and political possibilities. Notable case studies include a Guaraní territorial claim over Bolivia’s largest gas field, a regional autonomy initiative linking plurinationalism to gas revenues, and a conflict over gas development in a protected area. My interdisciplinary approach incorporates critical literature on law, rights, extraction, and indigeneity, utilizing ethnographic methods, counter-mapping, and documentary filmmaking to investigate the dynamics of land, law, and extractivism in relation to Indigenous autonomy and citizenship.

### Current Research Project

#### Untapped Reserves: Mapping Extraction and Resistance in Bolivia’s Protected Areas

In 2024, I was honored to receive a British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship, which will support my further research, the development of a book manuscript, and the production of a second documentary film. This work will focus on the political and territorial dynamics of gas extraction in Bolivia’s Tariquía Reserve of Flora and Fauna.

### Previous Research Projects

#### LEAKS – Extractive Enclaves and Unintended Flows

As a co-investigator on the *LEAKS* project (2019–2023), funded by the Independent Research Fund of Denmark, my research focused on conflicts over new natural gas development in the Tariquia National Reserve of Flora and Fauna.  I examined the spatial practices involved in neoextractivist territorialisation and how local women activists have resisted these through countertopographies that mobilise around extraction's leaky materialities. The research further illustrates how conservation geographies have become implicated in the governance of extraction in Bolivia's protected areas. A first article from this research will be published in the forthcoming Leaks Special Issue in the Journal of Latin American Geography.
