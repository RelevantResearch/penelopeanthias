As part of my project on extractive enclaves and unintended flows in Latin America, I directed and produced a 29-min open-access documentary called *Don't Touch Tariquía*, which charts the emergence and remarkable success of rural women's resistance to extraction in one area of the national park. Then, in 2023, I gained a Diploma in Creative Documentary Film-making at the Escuela Internacional de Cine y Television in Cuba, where I made a film about struggles over housing in a nearby textile village called *La Casa Nueva*.


### DON'T TOUCH TARIQUÍA: The Resistance of Chiquiacá
